Implementation of Flickr8k Image Captioning with a CNN LSTM baselines followed by improvements like:
1. Baseline with Attention.  
2. Baseline with Glove Embeddings. 
ResNet50 was the backbone used in the experiment. Please go through the [report](./report.pdf) to know more about the findings and observations. 

The PyTorch code for the task can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/monjoynchoudhury/captioning-task/notebook).
